This is a website for recognizing faces. I have used python library face_recognition for detecting and recognizing faces. The library extracts HOG features from each image and matches with different sized windows to find shape similar to that of a face for detecting faces. A pretrained ResNet model with 29 convolutional layers is used to encode images into 128 features. To match features of a test image to the saved encodings of the training images, the library uses a linear SVM. After recognizing and extracting features of training images, I have stored them and their names (to uniquely identify them) using the pynb file. App.py handles requests from the webpage. For server-side request handling, I have used Flask. App.py recognizes images and returns the names of the fixed number of suggestions to the front end. I have used HTML in the front end. The number of suggestions can be of any number. From the home page, the user has to provide a URL of the image and gets the suggestion of names (from most matched names to least matched).
